# Runtime Track: TypeScript / Node.js

> The default track. Choose it unless the project has a concrete reason to leave the JS ecosystem.

**Last verified: 2026-07-27** — every version below was checked against the npm registry
(`https://registry.npmjs.org/-/package/<name>/dist-tags`) and, where noted, against the vendor's own
docs on this date. When refreshing this file, re-verify and update this line.

## When to choose this track

- **One language across the whole stack.** Server, client, build scripts, and tests share types.
  For a small team this is the single biggest velocity multiplier available.
- **The UI is the product.** Anything with a real frontend starts here. React's ecosystem depth is
  not close to matched elsewhere.
- **You want to deploy in minutes, not days.** Vercel, Cloudflare, Netlify, Fly, and Railway all
  treat Node as a first-class target with zero-config adapters.
- **AI/LLM work.** The Vercel AI SDK and the Anthropic SDK are both first-class here, and streaming
  UI is a solved problem.

Leave this track when: you need heavy numeric/ML work in-process (`python.md`), you need a single
static binary or sub-10ms cold starts at high concurrency (`go.md`), you want batteries-included
server-rendered CRUD with a mature admin (`rails-laravel.md`), or you are shipping to App Store /
Play Store (`mobile-native.md`).

## Setup

The full-stack block was executed end to end on a clean machine at the versions pinned above; its
comments mark every place where the obvious command fails, with the full reproduction of each in
Gotchas. Copy those comments into step 1 of a blueprint — they are the difference between a first
verify command that exits 0 and one that does not.

```bash
# Pin the toolchain first — this is what makes a build reproducible.
# Bare `corepack enable` exits 1 with EACCES wherever the global bin dir is not writable
# (root-installed Node, most CI images). Prefer an explicit writable directory:
corepack enable --install-directory "$HOME/.local/bin"   # then ensure it is on PATH
corepack prepare pnpm@11.17.0 --activate
node -v   # expect v24.x

# --- Full-stack app (default) ---
# `--eslint=false` does NOT disable ESLint — the flag takes no value and is silently ignored.
# `--biome` is the flag that gives a Biome-only project.
# This command's own install ABORTS on ERR_PNPM_IGNORED_BUILDS and still exits 0. Do not trust it.
pnpm create next-app@latest my-app --ts --app --tailwind --biome --src-dir --use-pnpm
cd my-app
pnpm approve-builds --all           # pnpm 11 key is `allowBuilds`, NOT `onlyBuiltDependencies`
pnpm install --frozen-lockfile      # this is the real gate — it exits 0 only after the line above

# The scaffold pins biome 2.2.0 and typescript ^5 — override both to this track's pins.
pnpm add -D typescript@~6.0.3 @biomejs/biome@2.5.5 vitest@4 @playwright/test@1
pnpm add zod@4 @tanstack/react-query@5 drizzle-orm@0.45.2
pnpm add -D drizzle-kit@0.31.10
pnpm exec playwright install --with-deps   # tests fail hard without the browser binaries

# `--biome` already wrote biome.json and `biome init` refuses to overwrite it. EDIT it:
# bump "$schema" to .../2.5.5/schema.json and add the Tailwind parser option, or every
# CSS lint dies on the @theme block the scaffolder generated.
#   "css": { "parser": { "tailwindDirectives": true } }
pnpm exec biome check --write .   # reconcile the scaffold's formatting with the config, once
# Bare `shadcn init` prompts for a component library and blocks an unattended run.
# Pass it explicitly — `-b, --base` takes base | radix | aria, and the CLI's own default
# preset is Base UI, so "we chose Radix" is not true unless you say so on the command line.
pnpm dlx shadcn@4 init --base radix --no-monorepo

# --- Content / marketing site ---
pnpm create astro@latest my-site -- --template minimal --typescript strict
cd my-site && pnpm add -D typescript@~6.0.3   # Astro tooling requires the 6.x line
pnpm astro add tailwind sitemap

# --- Standalone API (no UI) ---
pnpm create hono@latest my-api
cd my-api && pnpm add zod@4 drizzle-orm@0.45.2 && pnpm add -D drizzle-kit@0.31.10 tsx@4

# --- SPA / non-Next React ---
pnpm create vite@latest my-spa -- --template react-ts
cd my-spa && pnpm add -D @tailwindcss/vite@4.3.3
```

## Conventions

```

  app/                  # Next.js App Router: routes, layouts, route handlers
    (marketing)/        # route groups for layout boundaries, not URL segments
    api/
  components/
    ui/                 # shadcn primitives — generated, edit freely, do not abstract early
    <feature>/          # feature-owned components

    auth.ts
    env.ts              # zod-parsed process.env, imported everywhere instead of process.env
  server/
    <feature>/          # server-only business logic; never imported from a "use client" file
proxy.ts                # NOT middleware.ts — see Gotchas

```

- **Server-first.** A component is a Server Component until it needs state or an event handler.
  `"use client"` goes on the smallest leaf that needs it, never on a layout.
- **Validate at every boundary.** `zod` schema for env, for each route handler body, for each form.
  Infer types from the schema (`z.infer`), never declare them twice.
- **300 lines is the component ceiling.** Past that, split by responsibility, not by line count.
- **No barrel files** (`index.ts` re-export hubs). They defeat tree-shaking and slow down every
  bundler and type-checker in this table.
- **`type` over `interface`** unless you need declaration merging. Consistency beats theology.
- **ESM only.** `"type": "module"` in `package.json` for anything that is not a Next.js app.

### Module resolution — decided once, for every loader

**Write `.ts` relative specifiers. Set `allowImportingTsExtensions` and
`rewriteRelativeImportExtensions`. That is the whole convention.**

This is the one decision a blueprint on this track must not re-open, because getting it wrong
produces two hard stops one command apart, and the second error arrives in a different tool than
the mistake. A blueprint that mandates `.js` specifiers "because ESM requires them" is correct for
the *emitted build* and fatal for any plain script — Node strips types but resolves specifiers
**literally**, so `./lib.js` cannot find `lib.ts`.

Verified on this machine, Node 24 / TypeScript 6.0.3:

| Context | Command that exercises it | What happens |
|---|---|---|
| App source | the framework bundler | resolves either form |
| Test files | the test runner | resolves either form |
| **Standalone scripts** | `node scripts/check.ts` | `.js` → `ERR_MODULE_NOT_FOUND` · **`.ts` → runs** |
| **Build** | `tsc -p tsconfig.build.json` | `.ts` without the flag → **`TS5097`** · with both flags → **exit 0** |

With both flags set, `tsc` rewrites `./lib.ts` to `./lib.js` on emit, so the built output runs on
plain Node with no loader. One convention, four contexts, nothing to reconcile later:

```jsonc
// tsconfig.json — the compiler options that make it work
{
  "compilerOptions": {
    "module": "nodenext",
    "allowImportingTsExtensions": true,      // lets source say ./lib.ts
    "rewriteRelativeImportExtensions": true  // emits ./lib.js so dist/ runs bare
  }
}
```

**Do not** solve this per-script with a loader hook, and do not let one context use `.js` while
another uses `.ts`. If a blueprint on this track states any import convention at all, it fills the
resolution convention matrix in its §19.6 with these four rows and this answer.

## Deployment notes

- **Next.js → Vercel.** Zero-config, and every feature in the table above ships there first. Self-host
  with `output: "standalone"` + a Node 24 slim image when you must.
- **Astro → Cloudflare Pages or Netlify.** Static output by default; add an adapter only when you
  actually need SSR.
- **Hono → Cloudflare Workers** (`wrangler deploy`) or a Node container. Hono's portability is the
  reason to pick it; do not import Node built-ins in shared handler code or you lose it.
- **Database.** Neon or Supabase for serverless Postgres; both give branch-per-PR databases, which
  is worth more than any performance difference at this stage.
- **Pin the runtime in CI.** `.nvmrc` with `24` and `packageManager: "pnpm@11.17.0"` in
  `package.json`. Unpinned CI is the most common source of "works on my machine".
- Run migrations as an explicit deploy step, never on app boot. Concurrent instances will race.

## Gotchas

The first five were reproduced by executing the exact pinned versions in this file on a clean
machine, not read off a changelog — each one breaks the **first verify command of the first step on
an untouched scaffold**, so copy them into step 1 of any blueprint on this track. The sixth (cron)
is quoted from the vendor's docs. Everything after that is documentation- or changelog-sourced.

- **pnpm 11 aborts install on a freshly scaffolded app: `ERR_PNPM_IGNORED_BUILDS`.** Dependencies
  with install/postinstall scripts do not run them unless explicitly allowed, and `pnpm install`
  exits **1** rather than warning. Reproduced on an untouched `create-next-app` project:
  `[ERR_PNPM_IGNORED_BUILDS] Ignored build scripts: sharp@0.34.5`. Three details that decide whether
  a build order survives this, all verified:
  1. **`pnpm create next-app` exits 0 anyway.** It prints `Aborting installation. pnpm install has
     failed.` and returns success, so a `set -e` script sails straight past it. The failure surfaces
     one step later at the first `pnpm install --frozen-lockfile` — which is exactly where a blueprint
     puts its first acceptance gate.
  2. **pnpm leaves a `pnpm-workspace.yaml` stub whose value is a sentence, not a value.** Verbatim
     from a clean scaffold: `allowBuilds:` / `  sharp: set this to true or false`, plus an
     `ignoredBuiltDependencies:` list (`sharp`, `unrs-resolver`). Anyone who skims the file sees the
     key already present and moves on. Set it to a real boolean:
     ```yaml
     allowBuilds:
       sharp: true
     ```
  3. **The key was renamed in pnpm 11 and the old one fails silently.** `onlyBuiltDependencies:` —
     the pnpm 10 key — is still accepted by the config reader and does nothing: verified that install
     still exits 1 with the identical error, no deprecation notice, no warning. That silence is what
     makes it cost two attempts instead of one.

  The one-command fix is `pnpm approve-builds --all` — non-interactive despite the name, it runs the
  scripts and rewrites the `allowBuilds` block for you; `pnpm install --frozen-lockfile` then exits 0.
  Read the package list off the error rather than hardcoding it: it changes with the scaffold flags
  (the ESLint variant pulls `unrs-resolver` in through `eslint-config-next`). A
  `dangerouslyAllowAllBuilds: true` escape hatch also exists; it discards the supply-chain gate the
  error is there to enforce, so never put it in a blueprint.

- **`create-next-app --eslint=false` is a no-op — the flag does not take a value.** The scaffolder
  does not parse `=false`; it treats the option as *unprovided* and applies the default, printing
  `Using defaults for unprovided options: --eslint  ESLint (use --biome for Biome, --no-eslint for
  None)`. Verified: `eslint` and `eslint-config-next` install anyway and `"lint": "eslint"` lands in
  `package.json` — silently contradicting a Biome-only decision. Use **`--biome`** (scaffolds
  `biome.json` and `"lint": "biome check"`, no ESLint anywhere) or `--no-eslint` for neither. Two
  follow-ons that a blueprint's step 1 must handle explicitly, both verified on the `--biome`
  scaffold: it pins `@biomejs/biome@2.2.0` and `typescript@^5` (resolved 5.9.3), **not** this file's
  `2.5.5` and `~6.0.3` — upgrade both in the next command; and `biome init` refuses to touch an
  existing `biome.json` ("It seems that a configuration file already exists", file left byte-identical),
  so the scaffolded config must be **edited**, not regenerated. Its defaults are
  `indentStyle: "space"`, `indentWidth: 2` — `biome init` would have written tabs, so any hand-written
  config or checked-in JSON in the blueprint must match whichever one actually ends up on disk or the
  project fails its own lint gate on files nobody wrote.

- **Biome cannot parse Tailwind v4's `@theme` until you turn its CSS parser option on.** With
  `@biomejs/biome@2.5.5` and Tailwind 4, `biome check` reports
  `parse × Tailwind-specific syntax is disabled` on `src/app/globals.css` — a file `create-next-app`
  generated. It is a parse failure, so no lint-rule override and no `--write` pass clears it. The key
  is exactly:
  ```json
  { "css": { "parser": { "tailwindDirectives": true } } }
  ```
  Verified: the only three keys Biome 2.5.5 accepts under `css.parser` are `allowWrongLineComments`,
  `cssModules`, and `tailwindDirectives` — `tailwindSyntax` and similar guesses are rejected with
  `Found an unknown key`. This is easy to miss because the scaffold's pinned Biome **2.2.0 parses the
  same file cleanly**; the break appears the moment you upgrade to the version this track pins. Set
  the key in the same step that installs Biome, before the first `lint` run. Cross-referenced as a
  role-level row in `knowledge/stack-compatibility.md`.

- **`corepack enable` fails with EACCES wherever the global bin directory is not writable.** Verified:
  `Internal Error: EACCES: permission denied, symlink '../lib/node_modules/corepack/dist/pnpm.js' ->
  '/usr/local/bin/pnpm'`, exit 1. This is the *first* command in the Setup block above, so it takes
  the whole build down on any machine where Node was installed as root, and on most CI images.
  `corepack enable --install-directory <writable-dir>` exits 0 and writes `pnpm`, `pnpx`, `yarn`,
  `yarnpkg` shims there; put that directory on `PATH`. A blueprint that lists `corepack enable` as a
  prerequisite must carry the fallback next to it, not leave the builder to find it.

- **`next/font` emits fallback `@font-face` rules with no `font-display`, and no option changes that.**
  A production build of an untouched `create-next-app` app has 13 `@font-face` rules in its CSS; 2
  have no `font-display`, and both are the metric-override fallbacks next/font generates —
  `font-family: Geist Fallback` / `Geist Mono Fallback`, `src: local(Arial)` plus
  `ascent-override` / `descent-override` / `size-adjust`. Verified that passing `display: "swap"` to
  the font loader does not add it: the count stays at 2 after a clean rebuild. `display` governs the
  real font faces only. Consequence for blueprints: an acceptance criterion of the form *"every
  shipped `@font-face` SHALL declare a font-display strategy"* is **unsatisfiable** while using
  next/font, and a builder will burn a step discovering that. Scope the criterion to the faces you
  control — "every `@font-face` that loads a font file over the network", or assert `display: "swap"`
  at the loader call site instead of over the built CSS.

- **Vercel Cron issues `GET`, so a `POST`-only scheduled endpoint never fires — silently.** Vercel's
  docs: *"To trigger a cron job, Vercel makes an HTTP GET request to your project's production
  deployment URL, using the `path` provided in your project's `vercel.json`."* A route handler that
  exports only `POST` returns 405 to every invocation, the schedule looks healthy in the dashboard,
  and the only symptom is that the work never happens. Related facts from the same docs, all of which
  a blueprint gets wrong by default: a cron path that does not exist returns 404 and **still counts as
  executed**; cron requests do **not** follow redirects, and a 3xx is treated as final; delivery is
  best effort and can both skip and duplicate a run, so handlers must be idempotent and
  reconciliation-based ("set status to active", never "increment by 10"); a long job can overlap its
  own next invocation, so take a lock; failures are never retried. Secure the endpoint with a
  `CRON_SECRET` env var — Vercel sends it as `Authorization: Bearer <secret>` — and compare it inside
  the `GET` handler. Every request also carries `user-agent: vercel-cron/1.0` and an
  `x-vercel-cron-schedule` header with the triggering expression, which is how one path serves two
  schedules. `vercel dev` / `next dev` do not run crons; hit the URL directly in local testing.
  If the job genuinely needs a request body, keep the `GET` handler as the trigger and have it call
  the real work — do not change the platform's method.

- **`middleware.ts` is gone — the file is now `proxy.ts`.** Renamed and deprecated in Next.js 16.0.0.
  The exported function is `proxy`, not `middleware`. Migrate with
  `npx @next/codemod@canary middleware-to-proxy .`. Proxy now defaults to the **Node.js runtime**, and
  setting the `runtime` route-segment config inside a proxy file throws.
  Related trap: Server Functions are POSTs to the route that uses them, so a matcher that excludes a
  path silently skips auth for its Server Functions. Authorize inside each Server Function.
- **`experimental.ppr` and `experimental.dynamicIO` no longer exist.** Next.js 16.0.0 folded `ppr`,
  `useCache`, and `dynamicIO` into a single top-level `cacheComponents: true` flag, paired with the
  `"use cache"` directive. `experimental_ppr` as a route-segment export was removed outright. Under
  `cacheComponents`, PPR is the default App Router behavior and navigation preserves state via React
  `<Activity>` — components stay mounted instead of unmounting.
- **Turbopack is the default for `next dev` AND `next build`** as of 16.0.0. Consequences: `webpack()`
  config in `next.config.js` is ignored, webpack *plugins* are unsupported (loaders are), Yarn PnP is
  unsupported, and `sassOptions.functions` does not work. Opt out per-command with `--webpack`.
  On platforms with no native bindings (FreeBSD, OpenBSD) `--webpack` is mandatory.
- **Drizzle v1 is a release candidate. Never pin `^1`.** The npm `latest` tag is `drizzle-orm@0.45.2`;
  `1.0.0-rc.4` sits behind the `rc` tag with dozens of ad-hoc prerelease tags around it. Pin the exact
  0.x pair (`drizzle-orm@0.45.2`, `drizzle-kit@0.31.10`) — a caret on a 0.x package still moves the
  minor, and Drizzle ships breaking changes in minors.
- **Tailwind v4 is configured in CSS, not JavaScript.** `@import "tailwindcss";` then `@theme { ... }`
  in your global stylesheet. If you see a `tailwind.config.js` in a v4 project it is a v3 leftover
  being ignored — delete it and port the tokens into `@theme`. Wire it with `@tailwindcss/vite` (Vite)
  or `@tailwindcss/postcss` (Next/PostCSS), never the old `tailwindcss` PostCSS plugin entry.
- **TypeScript 7 is GA but will break framework tooling.** `pnpm add -D typescript` installs **7.0.2**,
  the Go-native rewrite. It has no stable programmatic compiler API, so Vue, Svelte, Astro, MDX, and
  Angular template tooling must stay on the **6.0.x** line — Microsoft says so explicitly in the 7.0
  announcement. It also drops the `tsserver` binary (`bin` is `tsc` only), removes ES5/AMD/UMD targets,
  and defaults `strict: true` and `types: []`. **Next.js additionally refuses TS 7 unless you set
  `experimental.useTypeScriptCli: true`** — `next build` exits with instructions otherwise. Default to
  `typescript@~6.0.3` for the whole track; adopt 7 deliberately, per-project, for the 8–12x speedup.
- **Do not claim Next.js requires a specific React minor.** Its actual peer range is
  `"react": "^18.2.0 || 19.0.0-rc-de68d2f4-20241204 || ^19.0.0"`. React 18 apps upgrade to Next 16
  without touching React.
- **The React Compiler Vite export is `reactCompilerPreset`, not a "plugin".** From
  `@vitejs/plugin-react` 6.x: `import react, { reactCompilerPreset } from '@vitejs/plugin-react'`, then
  `plugins: [react(), babel({ presets: [reactCompilerPreset()] })]`. It needs `@rolldown/plugin-babel`,
  `@babel/core`, and `babel-plugin-react-compiler` as peers. There is no
  `preconfiguredReactCompilerPlugin` export in any current version — the README uses the word
  "preconfigured" only to describe the preset's default file filter.
- **Astro 7 has a Rust compiler that no longer forgives bad markup.** Unclosed non-void tags are now
  errors, and semantically invalid HTML is passed through as-is instead of being silently reordered.
  Expect a v6 → v7 migration to surface markup bugs that were previously invisible. It also requires
  Node `>=22.12.0`.
- **TanStack Start is on the 1.x line** (currently 1.168.32) and moves fast. Pin the exact version and
  upgrade deliberately; do not describe any single release as the long-awaited stable milestone.
- **The AI SDK's core and React packages are on different majors** (`ai` 7.x, `@ai-sdk/react` 4.x).
  Upgrading one without checking the other's peer range is a routine, avoidable break.

- `knowledge/shapes/data-pipeline-analytics.md` — pipelines default to
  `knowledge/runtime-tracks/python.md`; the dashboard on top of them lands here.
